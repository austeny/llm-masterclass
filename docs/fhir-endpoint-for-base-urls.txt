c. FHIR Endpoint for Service Base URLs

In the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we finalized API Maintenance of Certification requirements in 45 CFR 170.404(b)(2) which contain a specific provision requiring Certified API Developers, for Health IT Modules certified to the certification criterion in § 170.315(g)(10), to publicly publish certain “service base URLs”—otherwise known as “endpoints”—for all their customers and in a machine-readable format at no charge (85 FR 25764—25765). These electronic endpoints are the specific locations on the internet that make it possible for apps to access EHI at the patient's request.

As we developed these service base URL publication requirements in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule, we acknowledged the importance of industry alignment and standardization in this area by indicating that we “strongly encourage API Technology Suppliers, health care providers, HINs and patient advocacy organizations to coalesce around the development of a public resource or service from which all interested parties could benefit” (84 FR 7494). We ultimately did not adopt specific standards for the publication format of these service base URLs in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule to provide industry an opportunity to coalesce on specifications. We finalized § 170.404(b)(2) to require that Certified API Developers must make their service base URLs freely accessible and in a machine-readable format at no charge (85 FR 25765).

However, since the ONC Cures Act Final Rule was published, we have found that developers with publicly discoverable endpoint lists have defined their own bespoke publication approaches and unique formats. This variability across developers of certified health IT in the format they are using to publish their service base URLs indicates the industry has not coalesced around a common framework or approach. Research conducted through ONC's Lantern Project confirms this variability among developers of certified health IT, which is hindering maturation of a vibrant app ecosystem for patients and the healthcare community,[160] a primary objective within the Federal Health IT Strategic Plan.[161] The inconsistent implementation of our service base URL requirement has also rendered important data meant to facilitate connections to endpoints difficult to access.[162] Specifically, the organization details of the API Information Source associated with a service base URL is not always available, and even when available, is not always available in a format that can be readily used. Patient-facing apps require access to these service base URLs to provide patients access to information maintained by specific provider organizations that deploy certified API technology (i.e., API Information Sources). Without standardized formats and an ability to search for service base URLs, patients are hindered in their ability to find which service base URL(s) refer to their provider. Similar barriers exist for others involved in healthcare seeking to leverage apps for interoperability.

Additionally, it is difficult to map multiple, unique organizations to service base URLs. Experience to-date indicates that the name of the organization associated with a service base URL is typically formatted as free text (i.e., String). A single String is unable to represent the complexity of healthcare systems, where a system can contain many subsystems, or where a FHIR API URL can support a set of systems. Including all organizations that are serviced by a service base URL is important for discovery of which service base URL serves a particular health care provider, which in turn would allow API users to access relevant EHI through that service base URL. Having all healthcare organizations serviced by the service base URL accessible and in a standardized format would help app developers easily fetch information to enable patients and other users to access, exchange, and use information.

To address the inconsistencies in service base URL publication and challenges with mapping, we proposed in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule to revise the requirement in § 170.404(b)(2) to include new data format requirements (88 FR 23814). We anticipated that these new specifications would establish standards for industry adoption and better facilitate patient access to their health information. In the revised § 170.404(b)(2), we also proposed to incorporate the following existing requirements in § 170.404(b)(2)(i) and (ii): a Certified API Developer must publish service base URLs “[f]or all of its customers regardless of whether the Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) are centrally managed by the Certified API Developer or locally deployed by an API Information Source;” and publish these service base URLs “at no charge” as part of proposed § 170.404(b)(2). We proposed that Certified API Developers publish these standardized details by December 31, 2024.

In § 170.404(b)(2)(i), we proposed to require that service base URLs must be published in “Endpoint” resource format according to the FHIR standard adopted in § 170.215(a) (88 FR 23814). Additionally, in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) and subparagraphs § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(A) and § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(B), we proposed to require that organization details such as name, location, and provider identifiers (e.g., National Provider Identifier (NPI), CMS Certification Number (CCN), or health system ID) for each service base URL must be published in US Core “Organization” resource format according to the implementation specifications adopted in § 170.215(b)(1) (we note that elsewhere in this final rule, in section III.C.7.b, we discuss the proposal to move US Core IGs to § 170.215(b)(1)), with the “Organization.endpoint” element referencing the service base URLs managed by this organization.

We proposed the Endpoint and Organization resource formats because they are based on the FHIR Release 4 and US Core IG industry standards that are already adopted for use in the Program in § 170.315(g)(10). We specifically proposed the FHIR “Endpoint” resource because it is used for representing technical endpoint details and contains a required “address” element that, according to the FHIR R4 standard, contains “the technical base address for connecting to this endpoint.” [163] We noted that Certified API Developers would be able to populate this element, in each of their published “Endpoint” resources, with a service base URL that can be used by patients to access their EHI.

We additionally proposed the US Core “Organization” resource because it can be used to represent important contextual information around a service base URL (88 FR 23814 through 23815). We noted that the US Core “Organization” resource contains an optional “endpoint” element that can be used to reference “technical endpoints providing access to services operated for the organization.” [164] To standardize a link between published “Endpoint” resources and organization details relating to the organization that services these endpoints, we proposed to require, in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(A), that this optional “endpoint” element be populated on publicly published “Organization” resources and that they reference the “Endpoints” managed by the organization. We noted that “publicly published” meant that the information is made publicly available and noted that ONC will host a link to developers' service base URL list on the Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL) or another website hosted by ONC. We stated that this information would give the public a standard way of knowing how published “Endpoint” and published “Organization” resources are linked and which organization details apply to which service base URLs.

Additionally, we noted in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule that the US Core “Organization” resource contains a “mandatory” element called “name” that contains a “name used for the organization” (88 FR 23815). In addition to this required element, we proposed in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(B) to require Certified API Developers to make available “must support” elements of organization location and provider identifier(s) using the US Core “Organization” resource. An organization's location could be an address that is populated in the “address” element of the US Core “Organization” resource; and a provider identifier could be a National Provider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) number, or other health system ID populated in the “identifier” element. We noted that this information helps contextualize service base URLs and enables application developers to more easily and consistently provide patients access to their electronic health information.

Finally, we proposed, in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii), requirements for collection and maintenance of Endpoint and organization resources. Specifically, in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(A), we proposed to require that these resources be collected in a “Bundle” resource, according to the FHIR standard adopted in § 170.215(a), that the Certified API Developer would publicly publish (88 FR 23815). According to the FHIR specification, a “Bundle” acts as “a container for a collection of resources” and is widely used in use cases, such as returning search results and grouping resources as part of a message exchange.[165] 
Given the broad use of the “Bundle” resource throughout the FHIR specification (e.g., FHIR search), we noted in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule our expectation that most FHIR clients and FHIR application developers would be familiar with the “Bundle” resource and be able to parse “Bundle” resources electronically and extract relevant information from them for use in their application. Alternatively, we considered a different format for requiring that the Endpoint and Organization resources be collected for publication. We also considered the Newline Delimited JSON (ndjson) format (88 FR 23815). According to the ndjson specification, this format is convenient for publishing “structured data that may be processed one record at a time.” [166] The ndjson format is an efficient way for machines to parse large amounts of data given that the entire file does not need to be read into memory before parsing. As we noted in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule, we expect that these “Endpoint” and “Organization” JSON resource lists may be large, depending on the developer of certified health IT's client base. We noted our expectation that most Certified API Developers would be familiar with this format because it is included as an underlying standard in the FHIR Bulk Data Access IG required for certification to § 170.315(g)(10). Given the simplicity of the ndjson standard, we also noted our expectation that most FHIR clients and FHIR application developers would easily be able to parse ndjson files electronically and extract relevant information from them for use in their application.

We also proposed, in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(B), that Certified API Developers review Endpoint and Organization resources quarterly and, as necessary, update the information (88 FR 23815). We recognized that as customers upgrade and install new health IT, data provided in the Endpoint and Organization resources will change. In the HTI–1 Proposed Rule, we noted that a one-time publication of the developer's current list of endpoints for active customers upon certification to the § 170.315(g)(10) criterion will only meet initial certification requirements, and we proposed to establish in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(B) a requirement that Certified API Developers maintain this information over time. We also noted that failure to maintain the service base URLs and ensure the associated organization information remains up to date and free of errors or defects on a quarterly basis would be considered a violation of this Condition and Maintenance of Certification requirement and may result in corrective action. We clarified that any endpoint or organization information that is out of date, incomplete, or otherwise unusable for more than 90-days would be considered in violation of this proposed requirement.

Comments.

The majority of commenters support the continued development and standardization of publication formats for FHIR “service base URLs” otherwise known as “endpoints,” noting that standardization would better facilitate interoperability and address challenges that exist in operationalizing connections to FHIR servers for facilitating patient access. Many of these supportive commenters cautioned that our proposal does not align with the direction of industry and one 

commenter raised a particular concern that our proposal is not based in implementation experience and has not been informed by a draft implementation guide. Another commenter noted that since we are proposing that the “endpoint” element in the US Core “Organization” resource be used to reference FHIR R4 “Endpoint” resource(s), we should make specific and clear reference to the applicability of FHIR R4 and its detailed standards on Endpoint. Most of these commenters also offered suggestions on how we should change our proposal by citing the Argonaut implementation guide for Patient-access Brands as standard and the industry driven approach we should consider referencing for this endpoint publication use case.

Response.

We thank the commenters for their support of the continued development in this space and suggestions for improvement. The “Patient-access Brands” conceptual model, developed by the FHIR community through the Argonaut Project, has advanced significantly since publication of the HTI–1 Proposed Rule. A connectathon, which is an event where the FHIR community gathers and tests emerging FHIR standards, was held in May 2023 and it included developers of certified health IT and app developers who tested the real-world feasibility of the Patient-access Brands model.[167] Additionally, at the September 2023 HL7 Working Group Meeting, the FHIR community discussed and finalized new changes to the Patient-access Brands model.[168] Currently, the Patient-access Brands model is incorporated into a section of the continuous build draft version of the SMART App Launch IG.[169] This indicates that the Patient-access Brands model is now a draft specification and is on track for publication in a future version of the SMART App Launch IG.

We agree with commenters that the Patient-access Brands specification is a key standardized approach for the endpoint publication use case and we are committed to aligning our requirements with industry efforts. In the HTI–1 Proposed Rule, our proposal generally aligned with the current draft Patient-access Brands specification by calling for the use of “Organization” and “Endpoint” FHIR resources for representing endpoints (e.g., service base URLs) and corresponding organization (e.g., API Information Source) details in a standardized format.

Additionally, in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule, our proposal, similarly to the current draft of Patient-access Brands specification, called for the use of the “endpoint” element in the US Core “Organization” resource for linking “Endpoint” resources and organizational details relating to the organization that services this endpoint.[170] However, our proposal in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule is not an exact match of the underlying construct defined in the Patient-access Brands specification. One key difference that could result in incompatibilities between our requirements and the industry led efforts in the Patient-access Brands specification is that we referenced the US Core profile of the base FHIR “Organization” resource, while the Patient-access Brands specification includes its own custom profile of the base FHIR “Organization” resource. Both profiles are based off the base FHIR “Organization” resource, but they each contain their own sets of constraints to best match their use cases.

Based on commenter feedback, we do not believe it is necessary for us to impose US Core level “Organization” resource constraints and reference the FHIR “Organization” resource via the US Core IG at this time. We agree with the commenter who recommended a specific and clear reference to the applicability of FHIR R4. We realize that we introduced some unnecessary confusion by referencing two separate but related standards, namely FHIR R4 and US Core, in separate paragraphs of our proposed criterion updates in § 170.404(b)(2). To simplify our requirements and make a more specific and clear reference to FHIR R4, we believe it is necessary to reference one standard, namely FHIR R4. We also agree with the many commenters who emphasized the importance of considering and not conflicting with the standards developed by the FHIR community for the endpoint publication use case, and we believe that referencing the more general FHIR R4 standard for our Program reduces the risk of conflicting requirements.

To generalize our proposal, respond to commenter feedback, and to align our requirements with emerging industry standards for the endpoint discovery use case, we have finalized a modified version of our proposed requirements at § 170.404(b)(2). We have modified the standard referenced in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) to require the use of the base FHIR “Organization” resource instead of the more constrained US Core-profiled version of the base FHIR “Organization” resource. Specifically, we have revised § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) to reference the standard adopted in § 170.215(a). We emphasize that subparagraphs of finalized § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) remain largely unchanged, meaning that Certified API Developers will still be required to reference “Endpoint” resources using the “endpoint” element in the “Organization” FHIR resource and will still be required to publish organization details such as name, location, and facility identifier. With this modification, we have finalized a policy that is less prescriptive than what we proposed. By referencing the base FHIR “Organization” resource, instead of the US Core-profiled “Organization” resource, Certified API Developers have more flexibility to support the “Organization” resource without minimal element constraints and no elements are marked as “must support.” We note that when proposing the US Core “Organization” resource profile, we referenced certain mandatory and “must support” elements contained in that profile, including “address,” “name,” and “identifier.” We did not adopt these constraints; rather, we are leaving it up to the Certified API Developer to determine how best to publish the required organization details using the base FHIR standard instead of the more constrained US Core IG. Overall, this change will provide industry with more flexibility to meet Program requirements as standards evolve. We have finalized our proposal in § 170.404(b)(2) to require Certified API Developers to publish these standardized details by December 31, 2024, as proposed. We clarify that for the time period between when this final rule is effective and December 31, 2024, that Certified API Developers may fulfill their obligations at § 170.404(b)(2) by publicly publishing the service base URLs for all customers in a machine-readable format at no charge.

This modification supports our goal of addressing the inconsistent implementation of our service base URL requirement and better facilitates 

patient access to their health information by requiring the use of a consistent data format, while also reflecting feedback received from software developers, technology companies, and standards developer interested parties. This modification also better aligns our requirements with the underlying data format constructs currently defined in the leading, and still emerging, industry specification in this area, namely the Patient-access Brands specification. We hope to give Certified API Developers the option of using the data format structure in Patient-access Brands specification to publish their service base URLs and organization data we require without being in conflict with our data format requirements for the Program. We note that at the time of publication of this final rule, the Patient-access Brands specification is still in draft form and may evolve over time, including the addition of breaking changes. We will consider the Patient-access Brands specification for adoption in future rulemaking as it develops.

Comments.

In addition to the Patient-access Brands specification, several commenters noted the Directory IG for TEFCA as a standard to consider for the endpoint publication use case. All but one of these commenters cited the Directory IG for TEFCA alongside the Patient-access Brands specification and advocated for the alignment of TEFCA with the Patient-access Brands specification. One commenter advocated specifically for changes to our proposal based on the Directory IG for TEFCA, stating that we should consider it for defining the format of FHIR “Organization” and “Endpoint” resources for the endpoint publication use case.

Response.

We appreciate the notes from commenters pointing us to other work in the endpoint publication space to consider. The Directory IG for TEFCA is under active development and is being designed to support the TEFCA use case and the participants within that framework.[171] We agree that this IG is an important standard to keep in mind for supporting the endpoint publication use case more broadly but, because it already includes constraints and extensions that go beyond the relatively small set of elements we proposed requiring of developers, we do not agree with the commenter who suggested using it for specifying the format of FHIR “Organization” and “Endpoint” resources used for publishing endpoints in our Program at this time. However, we note that because we have finalized an approach in § 170.404(b)(2) that references the base FHIR standard, Certified API Developers have the flexibility to consider using “Organization” and “Endpoint” FHIR resources profiles, such as the profiles in the Directory IG for TEFCA, to meet our requirements.

Regarding the suggestions to align TEFCA with the Patient-access Brands specification, we thank commenters for this suggestion but note that it is outside the scope of the proposals related to TEFCA in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule. We will continue to monitor the development of these standards and may take them into consideration in future rulemaking.

Comments.

A number of commenters asked that we clarify the intended use of the organization details we proposed to be published. More specifically, commenters asked that we clarify that we expect organization or facility level identifiers, rather than individual practitioner identifiers, to be published. Many of these commenters noted that the publication of individual practitioner identifiers is out of scope for our intended use case. Additionally, one commenter noted the active work on a National Directory FHIR IG and said that it would be an approach to consider if we intend for practitioner level identifiers to be published.

Response.

We appreciate commenters' input and suggestions for clarity. We intend for these additional organization details to be used by app developers to help them map organizations to endpoints which, in turn, helps patients find the organization(s) they want to allow an app to access data from. We clarify that facility or organization level identifiers are sufficient to satisfy our proposed publication requirements. Facility level identifiers, for the purposes of certification to these Endpoint publication requirements, include identifiers such as: a National Provider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) number, CMS Certification Number (CCN), or other health system ID. Support for one of these identifier types is sufficient, meaning Certified API Developers are not required to publish individual NPIs as a floor for certification. Different identifiers may be used depending on the customers a Certified API Developer has. We have updated our regulatory text at § 170.404(b)(2)(ii)(B) to more clearly state that “[e]ach Organization resource must contain the organization's name, location, and facility identifier.”

For clarity and consistency, we have also updated our regulatory text at § 170.404(b)(2), and the relevant preamble text in this final rule, to replace the word “organizational” with “organization.” The phrase “organization details” more accurately represents the details we are referring to and is a consistent phrase to use in lieu of our mixed use of “organizational” and “organization” in the HTI–1 Proposed Rule.

Regarding the comment on the active work on a National Directory FHIR IG, we thank this commenter for pointing this out. Because we have not required the publication of individual provider-level identifiers, we are not considering this IG for the endpoint publication use case in our Program. We emphasize again that because we have finalized an approach in § 170.404(b)(2) that references the base FHIR standard, Certified API Developers have the flexibility to consider using “Organization” and “Endpoint” FHIR resources profiles, such as the profiles in the National Directory FHIR IG, to meet those requirements.

Comments.

A couple of commenters asked that we clarify our requirements for elements in the Endpoint and Organization FHIR resources if we are updating to US Core version 6.

Response.

We thank the commenters and we note that, given the changes we have made to § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) (see response to comments above), US Core is no longer in scope. We have modified the standard referenced in § 170.404(b)(2)(ii) to require the use of the base FHIR “Organization” resource instead of a US Core-profiled “Organization” resource.

Comments.

A few commenters responded to our invitation for comment on whether we should finalize our proposal to adopt a requirement for FHIR Endpoint and Organization resources to be made publicly available according to the FHIR Bundle format or if we should finalize the requirement to use a ndjson format. These commenters were generally split on which format they prefer. One commenter noted that large FHIR Bundles are challenging to parse. Another commenter suggested that we align with a format that is most compatible with Lantern to support certification.

Response.

We appreciate these responses and suggestions from commenters. We have finalized, at § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(A), our requirement for FHIR Endpoint and Organization resources to be collected in FHIR Bundle resource format. We recognize that large FHIR Bundles may be hard to parse given their size, but we anticipate that app developers will have the technology and access to the tools needed to parse large machine-readable artifacts. We also note that the current draft Patient-access Brands specification calls for the use of FHIR Bundles to collect FHIR Endpoint and Organization details.[172] We believe that our finalized requirement for publication using the FHIR Bundle resource format sufficiently supports app developers and aligns with industry direction.

We thank commenters for supporting Lantern, which is an open-source tool developed by ONC and the MITRE corporation “that monitors and provides analytics about the availability and adoption of FHIR API service base URLs (endpoints) across healthcare organizations in the United States.” [173] We anticipate that Lantern and other FHIR tools will be able to take advantage of our standards-based and machine-readable approach to monitor and discover FHIR endpoints. We also note that the Program will continue to explore ways to support conformance and certification to these requirements to enable patients and other users to access, exchange, and use information via discoverable FHIR APIs.

Comments.

One commenter suggested that both human readable and machine-readable Endpoint metadata be made available on the CHPL.

Response.

We thank this commenter for their suggestion. We acknowledge that human readable Endpoint metadata may be useful for some use cases, but we do not believe that is a necessary additional requirement to put on Certified API Developers in our Program. We note that by requiring machine-readable publication using a standardized FHIR format, developers can consider developing their own tools or leveraging existing community tools (e.g., Lantern) that render FHIR data into human readable formats.

Comments.

One commenter explicitly expressed support for the quarterly review timeline we proposed for Certified API Developers in § 170.404(b)(2)(iii)(B), while two commenters recommended changes to the timeline. The two commenters who recommended changes indicated that a quarterly review minimum was too long given that inaccurate organization details and non-functioning endpoints significantly hinders interoperability. One of these two commenters suggested the review timeline be one week and the other suggested that ONC notify organizations of any inaccurate information after 30 days and find them in violation if no corrective updates are made after 60 days.

Response.

We appreciate the feedback and thoughtful suggestions for possible improvement from commenters. We agree that this information needs to remain up to date to ensure application developers can easily and consistently provide patients access to EHI. We also acknowledge the need to consider the burden on Certified API Developers to keep their customers' endpoint information up to date. To balance value and burden, we have finalized the review timeline as proposed and have finalized a quarterly review timeline as the requirement. In response to commenters' suggestion that ONC monitor and notify interested parties of inaccurate information and initiate corrective action after 60 days, we note that we have a defined process to elevate concerns of non-conformity and we urge users or other interested parties to leverage this process.[174]

Comments.

Many commenters suggested that ONC work on a process for validating and monitoring these endpoints. Many of these commenters also suggested that we develop a directory of these endpoints. One commenter specifically cited our Lantern tool as a central place where these endpoints could be submitted and validated.

Response.

We thank the commenters for their feedback and suggestions. All Certified API Developer published Endpoint and Organization FHIR resource Bundles will be available publicly via the CHPL. Links to these Bundles are collected during the certification process by the ONC-Authorized Certification Bodies (ONC–ACB) and posted on a product's CHPL listing following successful certification. This public data can be used by anyone for collection and monitoring. This includes ONC's open-source Lantern tool. ONC hosts a public instance of this tool at https://lantern.healthit.gov/​ and collects data into this instance from many sources, including the CHPL, to monitor and provide analytics about the availability and adoption of FHIR API endpoints.[175] We encourage interested parties to visit the Lantern tool and we will continue to consider ways to ensure that service base URLs required in the Program continue to support individuals' access to their health information.

Comments.

A few commenters expressed concern over the burdens and challenges for EHR developers to collect this information from their customers and be responsible for it being up to date. This included comments that Certified API Developers should not be penalized if and when their customers do not provide this information. One commenter asked that ONC clarify that Certified API Developers can rely on assurances provided by their customers that this information is valid and up to date, because it will not be feasible for developers to independently validate the information, and that Certified API Developers should instead only be expected to publish information for customers that provide details to the Certified API Developers, rather than an expectation that endpoint and organization detail lists are comprehensive. A couple of commenters suggested the introduction of a CMS attestation for providers and hospitals to be responsible for this information and keeping it up to date.

Response.

We appreciate the feedback from commenters and acknowledge these concerns from Certified API Developers about gathering endpoint and organization information from their customers and being responsible for its publication. However, we did not propose and have not finalized any changes to our existing policy at § 170.404(b)(2) that requires Certified API Developers to publicly publish the service base URLs for all of their customers regardless of whether the Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) are centrally managed by the Certified API Developer or locally deployed by an API Information Source. As we said in the ONC Cures Act Final Rule with regards to publication of service base URLs, we believe that Certified API Developers will have adequate relationships with API Information Sources in the process of providing Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) to gather the necessary information (85 FR 25765). We believe that these same relationships are adequate for Certified API Developers to be able to collect and publish service base URLs, organization names, organization locations, and facility identifiers on behalf of their customers. We do not agree that it will be infeasible for Certified API Developers to provide validated URLs for customers that locally deploy certified API technology because details related to customer names, organization locations, and facility identifiers should be routinely and readily available during the business process (i.e., a Certified API Developer licensing or selling use of certified API technology to a customer). We remind commenters of our focus for this criterion on service base URLs and related organization details for Health IT Modules certified to § 170.315(g)(10) that can be used by patients to access their EHI. We believe that the effort needed to collect this information is warranted given the critical role it plays in enabling third-party apps to access EHI at a patient's request.

We appreciate the feedback and suggestions from commenters on potential points of intersection between our requirements and CMS requirements. Updates to CMS programs are out of scope of this rule, but we encourage commenters to submit such ideas to CMS.

Comments.

A few commenters suggested that we work with CMS and other federal partners to ensure our requirements do not duplicate other efforts and to ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to support this requirement. One commenter specifically cited CMS's ongoing effort to develop a national directory.

Response.

We appreciate the feedback from commenters. We will continue to coordinate and work with our federal partners, including CMS, on points of intersection for potential future rulemaking.
